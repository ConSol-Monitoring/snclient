## General

SNClient is written in golang which comes which some benefits regarding security.

- Native TLS/SSL Support

  Since there are no external ssl/tls libraries, SNClient always comes with
  latest TLS support even on legacy systems (if you regularly update SNClient).

- Strong Encryption and Security Standards

  Go's TLS/SSL implementation supports modern encryption and security
  standards, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of
  data transmitted over the network.

- Secure Ciphers by Default

  Starting with TLS 1.3 Go automatically selects secure ciphers. There is no
  need to set them manually.

## Code Signing

The windows builds (both snclient.exe and the .msi installer) and can be verified
with the signtool.exe from the windows developer sdk, ex.:

```powershell
signtool.exe verify /pa snclient.exe
```

## Recommendations

### Update Regularly

Always keep SNClient on the latest release version to benefit from security

See the [updates page](../updates/) for instructions.

### Use SSL

Use ssl/tls whenever possible.

```ini
[/settings/default]
use ssl = true
```

### HSTS Header

SNClient supports sending HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers.
This is enabled by default for all ssl/tls web server modules.

The HSTS header tells browsers to automatically use HTTPS for all future connections
to the server, which is totally useless in SNClient context because it usually
won't be directly accessed from a browser. But this makes super smart penetration tests
happy.

The header is set to:

- `max-age=31536000` (1 year)

To disable HSTS headers in case this creates issues somehow:

```ini
[/settings/WEB/server]
use hsts header = false
```

Or to disable it for all HTTP servers:

```ini
[/settings/default]
use hsts header = false
```

### TLS 1.3

If possible, set minimum required TLS version to 1.3. Since the number of
clients is limited there is no need to support old browsers.

```ini
[/settings/default]
tls min version = "tls1.3"
```

### Client certificate verification

You can enable client certificate verification using `ca` or `client certificates` options
(both options has the same meaning, `ca` option was added for backward compatibility with NSclient).
You can find example how to generate certificates bellow.

- `certificate` specify server certificate
- `certificate key` specify server key
- `ca` and/or `client certificates` specify the CA certificate for certificate verification and enable verification itself.

```ini
[/settings/default]
certificate = ${certificate-path}/server.crt
certificate key = ${certificate-path}/server.key
client certificates = ${certificate-path}/ca.pem
;ca = ${certificate-path}/ca.pem
```

#### Certificate generation example

1. Generate CA certificate

   ```bash
   # generate CA key
   openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca/ca.key 4096
   # generate CA certificate
   openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca/ca.key -sha256 -days 7500 -out ca/ca.pem -subj "/C=US/L=New York/O=Company/CN=My CA"
   ```

2. Generate client certificate

   ```bash
   # generate client key
   openssl genrsa -out client1.key 4096
   # generate client certificate request
   openssl req -new -key client1.key -out client1.csr -subj "/C=US/L=New York/O=Company/CN=Client"
   # sign client certificate by CA
   openssl x509 -req -in client1.csr -out client1.pem -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca/ca.key -CAcreateserial -days 7300 -sha256
   ```

3. Generate server certificate

   ```bash
   # generate server key
   openssl genrsa -out server.key 4096
   # generate server certificate request
   openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj "/C=US/L=New York/O=Company/CN=Server"
   # sign server certificate by CA
   openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -out server.pem -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca/ca.key -CAcreateserial -days 7300 -sha256
   ```

### Allowed Hosts

Using the `allowed hosts` option is a great way to simply block all clients except
your monitoring hosts. This greatly lowers the number of possible attacks.

As a tradeoff between security and maintainability you could add the admin net
here instead of single IPs.

```ini
[/settings/default]
allowed hosts = 127.0.0.1, ::1, 192.168.56.0/24
```

### Hashed Password

SNClient supports using hashed passwords so you do not have clear text passwords
in the ini files. Use `snclient hash` to generate a new password hash.

```ini
[/settings/default]
password = SHA256:9f86d081...
```

### Allow Nasty Characters

It is recommended to **not** enable `allow nasty characters` as this allows
to exploit existing commands.

```ini
[/settings/default]
allow nasty characters = false
```
