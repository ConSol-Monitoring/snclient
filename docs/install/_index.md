# Installation

## Using Binary Packages

Using packages is the recommended way to install SNClient+.

### Stable Releases
Installation packages from stable releases can be found here:

- https://github.com/ConSol-Monitoring/snclient/releases

### Development Snapshots
During development each code commit produces build artifacts if all tests were
successful.

Usually you should stick to the stable releases unless told otherwise or you want
to test something.

Installing the development snapshot is straight forward:

1. Open https://github.com/ConSol-Monitoring/snclient/actions/workflows/cicd.yml?query=branch%3Amain
2. Choose first green build like in

3. Scroll down and choose the download which matches your architecture:

4. Install just like the stable release files.


## Building SNClient From Source

Building snclient from source is covered in detail here: [Building from source](build)


## Firewall

The windows .msi package will add the firewall exceptions automatically. If you changed
the listener configuration, like ports or the enabled listeners, ex.: NRPE, Web
you can update the firewall configuration with this command:

	C:\Program Files\snclient> .\snclient.exe install firewall

If you don't need the exceptions anymore, there is an uninstall command as well:

	C:\Program Files\snclient> .\snclient.exe uninstall firewall

## Advanced Windows Installation

Running the .msi installer manually lets you choose some basic options. The idea
here is to set the ports, so the following firewall setup will know which ports
to open.

All none basic options should go into a local custom ini file which can be
provided during installation as well.

Installing the msi from the terminal with `msiexec.exe` provides those options
as public property.

ex.:

	msiexec.exe /i snclient.msi /l*V snclient_installer.log /qn PASSWORD="test" INCLUDES="https://company.local/snclient_local.ini"

Installs the .msi and logs everything into the snclient_installer.log logfile. It
also sets the initial password and sets a ini file fetched by https.

Here is a table of all available properties:

| Propery | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| INCLUDES             |     | Adds include files to the /Includes section. |
| ALLOWEDHOSTS         | 127.0.0.1, ::1    | Sets the 'allowed hosts'. |
| PASSWORD             | CHANGEME    | Sets the password (will be written to the .ini encrytped).       |

| WEBSERVERPORT        | 8443    | Set port for web server.       |
| WEBSERVERSSL         | 1    | Enable/Disable TLS/SSL for the web server.       |
| NRPESERVER           |  0   | Enable/Disable the NRPE server.       |
| NRPESERVERPORT       | 5666    | Set port for NRPE server.       |
| NRPESERVERSSL        | 1    | Enable/Disable TLS/SSL for the NRPE server.       |
| PROMETHEUSSERVER     | 0   | Enable/Disable the Prometheus web server.       |
