There are several prometheus integrations in SNClient.

## Overview

- [Builtin Windows Exporter](#windows-exporter)
- [Builtin Node Exporter](#node-exporter)
- [Managed Exporters](#managed-exporters)
- [ExporterExporter](#exporter-exporter)
- [Prometheus Metrics of SNClient](#metrics)

## Windows Exporter

When running SNClient on windows there is a builtin windows exporter.

[Read more about the windows_exporter](windows).

## Node Exporter

When running SNClient on linux or osx there is a builtin node exporter.

[Read more about the node_exporter](node).

## Managed Exporters

Managed exporters are exporters started and managed by SNClient. They will get
a unique assigned url in the main webserver of SNClient.

[Read more about managed exporters](managed).

## Exporter Exporter

The exporter_exporter (expexp) is a reverse proxy for already existing exporters.
[Read more about this exporter](exporter).

The exporter exporter is for exporters not managed by SNClient.

## Metrics

SNClient itself is a prometheus exporter as well and provides some metrics
about the agent process.

It can be enabled in the modules section of the `snclient.ini`.

```ini
[/modules]
PrometheusServer = enabled

[/settings/Prometheus/server]
port = 9999
use ssl = false
password =
```

You can then scrape prometheus metrics from `http://<ip>:9999/metrics`.
